      <description>In 2014â€”2017, my blog was based on Jekyll, which was a logical choice because I host it on GitHub pages. Now I have moved to Hugo. This is because of Blogdown and its support for R Markdown. My earlier site was also based on Markdown. However, R Markdown enables one not only to cite program code, but to execute it.
Little bit similarly as Jupyter Notebook, R Markdown makes it possible to run code on a static HTML page.</description>
