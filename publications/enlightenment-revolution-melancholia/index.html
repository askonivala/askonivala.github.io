<p>In the article I also analysed sites of Romantic melancholy using  Chateaubriand’s <em>René</em> (1802) in an example map that presents the toponyms mentioned in the novel embedded with their textual context:</p>
<p><img src="/img/enlightenment.png" alt="A map of toponyms and their textual contexts in René (1802). Asko Nivala."></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip; The place names are embedded with their textual contexts to show Chateaubriand’s interpretations of the places. The toponym ‘Europe’ is located around the Netherlands, because, as a region, it cannot be represented with a point, while the American places are on the smaller map. The map shows the way in which the sites of Romantic melancholy are often located on the periphery. René visits the northern parts of Scotland, the location of <em>Ossian</em> (1760), while also climbing Mount Etna in Sicily, combining peripheral places in both the north and south. Rome is also a very typical destination of Romantic narratives, combined with a tour of the Greek ruins. Although Rome can be considered an urban centre, René sees it through its art and history. It is remarkable that in many Romantic narratives, both Italy and Greece are represented as ancient places without any references to their contemporary histories, although Italy was an important battle scene in the Napoleonic Wars and Greece was still part of the Ottoman Empire. René also moves on an exceptionally wide horizontal axis, because its frame narrative is located in the remoteness of Louisiana.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
