      <description>Lived and Imagined Space in English and German Romantic Texts, 1790–1840 Most texts are spatial implying a network of places. This was especially typical of the Romantic era (1790s–1840s) that was characterised by the growing interest in historical and natural sites. Romantic Cartographies is a digital humanities project that provides new interpretations on English and German Romantic texts by focusing on spatiality. It analyses the spatiality of Romantic texts by reconstructing the various maps they implied.</description>
