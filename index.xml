      <title>Thinking Beyond the Human: Mechanical Automata and Societal Upheaval in the Romantic Era</title>

Achim von Arnim’s &lt;em&gt;Gräfin Dolores&lt;/em&gt; (1810) already imagines humans threatened by soulless automata, while Mary Shelley’s &lt;em&gt;Frankenstein&lt;/em&gt; (1818) reworks myth of the golem to depict a human-made being turning against its creator. Samuel Butler’s “Darwin among the Machines” (1863) later framed this as the displacement of humanity by a machine race. Such nineteenth-century dystopias anticipate current debates on rogue AI and automation-driven unemployment, echoing the industrial revolution’s anxieties while illuminating today’s cultural fears of technological supremacy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence Before Computers: The History of Romantic Computationalism</title>
      <link>https://askonivala.github.io/projects/aicom/</link>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;pi-asko-nivala&#34;&gt;PI: Asko Nivala&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Machine learning and neural networks have developed significantly during the twenty-first century. Despite the success of weak artificial intelligence, strong AI – the creation of an artificial consciousness comparable with humans – is still as much science fiction as it was when Mary Shelley published &lt;em&gt;Frankenstein&lt;/em&gt; (1818). My research project &lt;em&gt;Artificial Intelligence Before Computers&lt;/em&gt; (AICOM) explores the history of AI discourse before the invention of the electronic computer. The utopia of a thinking machine is based on computationalism, which argues that human mind operates like a computer. As a philosophical idea, computationalism is much older than computing hardware: already Thomas Hobbes and G. W. Leibniz maintained that all reasoning is reducible to addition and subtraction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

August 2025, 11:00–12:30&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This hands-on workshop introduces the basic principles of geoparsing – the process of identifying and interpreting place references in textual sources. Through practical exercises and group discussion, participants will learn how spatial information embedded in historical and literary texts can be extracted, visualised and analysed to support new kinds of research questions. No prior programming skills are required. By the end of the session, participants will have experimented with accessible tools to explore how texts can be transformed into maps, and how spatial approaches can enrich cultural and historical analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Travelling in Romantic Bildungsroman Narratives</title>
      <link>https://askonivala.github.io/publications/bildung/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The early nineteenth-century bildungsroman is often understood as a coming-of-age story of the protagonist, which implies that temporality is more constitutive for its composition than spatiality. In contrast, my paper focuses on the motif of travelling in German and British bildungsroman narratives. Opposed to the previous allegorical understanding of the Romantic bildungsroman, I suggest that the methods of the spatial humanities open up a new perspective on bildungsroman narratives by showing how their travel itineraries were used in the construction of Europe before and after the Napoleonic Wars. The itineraries annotated from the corpus suggest that the classic Grand Tour to Italy remain important, especially in German Romanticism, whereas northern regions are also popular in British texts. A few narratives emphasise the region of Greece in defining the European frontier in relation to the Ottoman Empire, while Russia and Poland are not popular settings for bildungsroman narratives.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Geoparsing and the Spatial Turn in Cultural History</title>

August 2025, 9:30–10:30&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Geoparsing refers to the extraction of spatial information from unstructured text, typically through the identification and disambiguation of place names. This process enables the conversion of texts into maps. In the context of cultural heritage, geoparsing offers new avenues for cultural-historical research and the study of spatial history. Where are the centres and peripheries of a textual corpus?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this lecture, I introduce the basic principles of geoparsing technology and demonstrate its practical application in cultural-historical research through two case studies. The first draws on my project Romantic Cartographies: Lived and Imagined Space in English and German Romantic Texts, 1790–1840, which investigated spatial constructions in early nineteenth-century German- and English-language Romantic literature, using materials from the digital archive European Literature, 1790–1840: The Corvey Collection. The second example comes from the project Atlas of Finnish Literature, 1870–1940 mapping place names mentioned in Finnish-language fiction from that period.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Gears of Discontent: Mechanical Automata and Societal Upheaval in the Romantic Era</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My paper explores how the Romantic rebellion against the creator was transformed into the idea of a rebellion of machines. Samuel Butler’s “Darwin among the Machines” (1863) is considered the first text to introduce the idea of a machine race displacing humans. However, a similar fear was also expressed during the Romantic period. In &lt;em&gt;Gräfin Dolores&lt;/em&gt; (1810) by Achim von Arnim, the Count Karl feels anxious after encountering automata of a mysterious doctor: “Still, he was tormented by the feeling of being completely alien and alone in the power of soulless machines, which, created by humans, could easily gain supremacy over him.” (&lt;em&gt;Werke I&lt;/em&gt;, p. 404; my translation.) While Mary Shelley’s &lt;em&gt;Frankenstein&lt;/em&gt; (1818) does not address the AI takeover as we understand it today, it does explore the idea of a human-created entity rebelling against its creator. In this case, the entity is not a machine but the Creature, an assemblage of body parts brought to life through unspecified scientific means. Shelley’s novel can be read as a reinterpretation of Milton’s Satan or the golem myth, but it also refers to the myth of Prometheus, popular in German Romanticism. Both Goethe and Friedrich Schlegel refer to Promethean efforts to manufacture a race of artificial humans who despise God. What historical process led to Roy the replicant (mis)quoting William Blake’s &lt;em&gt;America a Prophecy&lt;/em&gt; (1793) in &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner&lt;/em&gt; (1982)? Blake’s character Orc is the embodiment of rebellion against Urizen, but Ridley Scott’s film is about the rebellion of machines against humanity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Romantic Irony: Transcendental Reflection of Artistic Form</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Friedrich Schlegel’s concept of irony emphasises self-awareness and self-reflexivity, allowing the work of art to create and question its own rules. Much like Kant’s transcendental knowledge, Schlegel’s formulation of art generates its own poetical rules from within, underscoring an autonomous quality.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Asko Nivala: &amp;ldquo;Romantic Irony: Transcendental Reflection of Artistic Form&amp;rdquo;, an invited presentation at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.uniarts.fi/en/events/kuva-research-days-day-1/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Romantic Irony&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; symposium.

      <title>The Construction of Space in English and German Literature 1790–1848</title>
      <link>https://askonivala.github.io/publications/corvey/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this article, I analyse named entity linking as a new method to study the construction of space in the English and German texts of European Literature, 1790–1840: The Corvey Collection. The Corvey Collection is among the most comprehensive datasets to have survived from the Romantic Era of literature. However, German-language documents in particular suffer from poor OCR scanning. To avoid noise caused by incorrectly digitized characters, I have re-OCRed the collection. In contrast to named entity recognition, named entity linking is able to disambiguate toponyms and find coordinates for them from linked open data sources such as DBpedia. I have then imported the geocoded places to geographic information systems, which enables comparing spaces imagined in British and German literature from the 1790s to the 1840s. To link spatial information to the semantic content of texts, I have applied topic modeling to find common themes shared by the works. Studying the spatial imagination of the popular texts published in the Romantic era discloses an alternative view to our present notion of Romanticism based on the close reading of a few canonized authors. The comparison of English and German corpora shows the way in which the spatial imagination reflected the asymmetrical relationship of center and periphery: the core of British literature was located in London, whereas no single center appears in the German-language data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Using word vector models to trace conceptual change over time and space in historical newspapers, 1840–1914</title>
      <link>https://askonivala.github.io/publications/shico/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Linking large digitized newspaper corpora in different languages that have become available in national and state libraries opens up new possibilities for the computational analysis of patterns of information flow across national and linguistic boundaries. The significant contribution this article presents is to demonstrate how word vector models can be used to explore the way concepts have shifted in meaning over time, as they migrated across space, by comparing newspapers from different countries published between 1840 and 1914. We define a concept, rather pragmatically, as a key term or core idea that has been used in historical discourse: an abstraction or mental representation that has served as a building block for thoughts and beliefs. We use historical newspapers in English, Finnish, German and Swedish from collections in the UK, US, Germany, and Finland, as well as the Europeana collection. As use cases, we analyze how the different conceptual constructs of “nation” and “illness” emerged and changed between 1840 and 1920. Conceptual change over time is simulated by creating a series of overlapping word vector models, each spanning ten years. Historical vocabularies are retrieved on the basis of vector space proximity. Conceptual change across space is simulated by comparing the historical change of vocabularies in newspaper collections from different nations in several languages. This computational approach to conceptual history opens up new ways to identify patterns in public discourse over longer periods of time and across borders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

What kind of maps do the classics of our literature draw? Where are the centres and peripheries of Finnish literature? Literary cartography emerged in the late 1990s as part of the spatial turn in the humanities. In the 2000s, it has adopted the methods of digital humanities, combining the processing of natural languages with geographic information system. The &lt;em&gt;Atlas of Finnish Literature 1870-1940&lt;/em&gt; project applies these new methods for the first time to the study of Finnish fiction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The chapter concentrates on the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries and analyzes the ambiguous project of the Enlightenment. The eighteenth century has often been depicted as an era of progress, when new scientific inventions were made and disseminated while the middle class gained more economic and political influence. The 1750s was a turning point, however, after which European intellectual history started to show darker shades and a new sceptical attitude to progress arose. At the end of the century, the Great Revolution of France brought a wave of unrest, wars and, finally, harsh manifestations of political terror. The chapter explores the heritage of the era of revolutions and its impact on the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The reuse of texts in Finnish newspapers and journals, 1771–1920</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The digital collections of newspapers have given rise to a growing interest in studying them with computational methods. This article contributes to this discussion by presenting a method for detecting text reuse in a large corpus of digitized texts. Empirically, the article is based on the corpus of newspapers and journals from the collection of the National Library of Finland. Often, digitized repositories offer only partial views of what actually was published in printed form. The Finnish collection is unique, however, since it covers all published issues up to the year 1920. This article has a two-fold objective: methodologically, it explores how computational methods can be developed so that text reuse can be effectively identified; empirically, the article concentrates on how the circulation of texts developed in Finland from the late eighteenth century to the early twentieth century and what this reveals about the transformation of public discourse in Finland. According to our results, the reuse of texts was an integral part of the press throughout the studied period, which, on the other hand, was part of a wider transnational practice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The assassination of Nikolay Bobrikov, the Governor-General of Finland, on 16 June 1904 was a turning point in Finnish history. It was reported in hundreds, if not thousands, of newspapers worldwide. This article follows the spread of that news, particularly its spread over the first week after the assassination. The study draws on the digital newspaper repositories in Australia, Austria, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Mexico, Sweden, the Netherlands and the United States. It also draws on the microfilm and physical collections of Russian newspapers at the National Library of Finland. The article shows how the murder activated the telegram network and initiated a series of news waves. The routes the Bobrikov news travelled, their tempo and the evolution of related stories tell a story of a networked but biased global news scene. In that scene, technological, commercial and cultural factors simultaneously facilitated and controlled what stories reached which papers and how.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;From August to December 2019, I was a visiting scholar &lt;a href=&#34;https://cssh.northeastern.edu/nulab/romantic-cartographies-visiting-speaker-nivala/&#34;&gt;hosted by the NULab for Texts, Maps, and Networks and the Digital Scholarship Group&lt;/a&gt;. NULab was part of the Oceanic Exchanges consortium.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The NULab has built significant expertise in many varieties computational humanities work, with colleagues in literary study, history, computer science, and the social sciences all contributing methodological and domain knowledge. Being a postdoc in this research community greatly benefited the cartographical aspects of my &lt;a href=&#34;./projects/romcar/&#34;&gt;ROMCAR&lt;/a&gt; project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>History and Virtual Topology</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Drawing on a new materialist approach, this article discusses the concepts of the virtual and virtual topology, and their fruitfulness for historians’ empirical work. It starts by following Gilles Deleuze’s argument that the virtual, the transformative potential of the real, has to be distinguished from the possible, which is merely an imagined double of the given world. Embracing this premise, the article shows the potential of virtual topology to shed light on the transformation of a network in the past. It suggests that history is not only about actual and stable things, it is also a site of becomings. This idea is elaborated through an analysis that focuses on the changes in the nineteenth-century Finnish press. The virtual as a theoretical concept is combined with the methodological opportunities offered by recent developments in the digital humanities, in this case, text reuse detection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Romantic Idea of the Golden Age in Friedrich Schlegel&#39;s Philosophy of History</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Asko Nivala: &lt;em&gt;The Romantic Idea of the Golden Age in Friedrich Schlegel&amp;rsquo;s Philosophy of History&lt;/em&gt;. Routledge, New York 2017, &lt;a href=&#34;https://books.google.de/books?id=jecNDgAAQBAJ&amp;amp;pg=PT0=#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false&#34;&gt;PREVIEW&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.routledge.com/The-Romantic-Idea-of-the-Golden-Age-in-Friedrich-Schlegels-Philosophy/Nivala/p/book/9781138635180&#34;&gt;ORDER&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The nineteenth-century Romantic understanding of history is often confused with the longing for the past Golden Age. In this book, the Romantic idea of Golden Age is seen from a new angle by discussing it in the context of Friedrich Schlegel’s works. Interestingly, Schlegel argued that the concept of a past Golden Age in the beginning of history was itself a product of antiquity, imagined without any historical ground. The Golden Age was not bygone for Schlegel, but to be produced in the future. His utopian vision of the Kingdom of God was related to the millenarian expectations of perpetual peace aroused by the revolutionary wars. Schlegel understood current era through the kairos concept, which emphasized the present possibilities for public agency. Thus history could not be reduced to any kind of pre-established pattern of redemption, for the future was determined only by the opportunities manifested in the present time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Romantic Cartographies: Lived and Imagined Space in English and German Romantic Texts, 1790–1840</title>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;pi-asko-nivala&#34;&gt;PI: Asko Nivala&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most texts are spatial implying a network of places. This was especially typical of the Romantic era (1790s–1840s) that was characterised by the growing interest in historical and natural sites. &lt;a href=&#34;https://askonivala.github.io/romcar/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Romantic Cartographies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was a digital humanities project that provided new interpretations on English and German Romantic texts by focusing on spatiality. It analysed the spatiality of Romantic texts by reconstructing the various maps they implied. The geoparsing method developed during the project enabled mining locational data from an exceptionally big textual corpus. The results of text mining was visualised as superimposed maps, which produced new knowledge about the relationship of centre and periphery, or urban and natural areas in Romanticism.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;pi-prof-hannu-salmi&#34;&gt;PI: Prof. Hannu Salmi&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The consortium Computational History and the Transformation of Public Discourse in Finland, 1640–1910 (funded by the Academy of Finland programme on Digital Humanities, 2016–2019) is based on the cooperation of four partners: The Faculty of Humanities at the University of Helsinki, the Departments of Cultural History and Future Technologies at the University of Turku and the Centre for Preservation and Digitisation of the National Library of Finland. This brings together relevant complementary expertise on the research subject (eighteenth- and nineteenth-century history), methodology (computational sciences and language technology) and data (the preservation and enhancement of digital resources). The objective of the consortium is to reassess the scope, nature, development, and transnational connections of public discourse in Finland, 1640–1910.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Catastrophic Revolution and the Rise of Romantic Bildung</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Asko Nivala: &amp;ldquo;Catastrophic Revolution and the Rise of Romantic Bildung&amp;rdquo;, &lt;em&gt;Travelling Notions of Culture in Early Nineteenth-Century Europe&lt;/em&gt;. Eds. Hannu Salmi, Asko Nivala, Jukka Sarjala. Routledge, New York 2015, pp. 19-37, PREVIEW / ORDER.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I discuss the rise of Romantic &amp;lsquo;Bildung&amp;rsquo; at the turn of the nineteenth century with a special emphasis on Friedrich Schlegel, but referring also to other famous Romantics such as William Wordsworth and Novalis (Friedrich von Hardenberg, 1772–1801). First, I will outline the rise of Romantic &amp;lsquo;Bildung&amp;rsquo; in relation to the French Revolution, which was compared with a sublime natural disaster. Second, I will show how the Revolution was conceived in a spatial framework of the geographic ‘border’, which distanced one’s own country from the French turmoil. The third part of this chapter will argue that the early nineteenth-century Romantic juxtaposition of &amp;lsquo;Bildung&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;civilisation&amp;rsquo; was based on a rehabilitation of periphery (countryside) and semiperiphery (small medieval towns) as the sites of original national &amp;lsquo;Bildung&amp;rsquo;, against Paris as the universal centre of civilisation. This chapter will thus thematise a hidden tension in the Romantic concept of culture: its dual reference to (1) the ontological separation between nature’s mechanical necessity and human freedom, and (2) to the geographic borderlines and topographical differences between national cultures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This book focuses on how space and spatiality contributed to defining the concepts of culture and civilization and, conversely, what kind of spatial ramifications &amp;lsquo;culture&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;civilization&amp;rsquo; entailed. These questions have vital importance to the understanding of this formative period of modern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;pi-asko-nivala&#34;&gt;PI: Asko Nivala&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I defended my doctoral dissertation in 2015. It discussed the themes of the Golden Age and the Kingdom of God in Friedrich Schlegel’s (1772–1829) early thought. The project was funded by the Finnish Cultural Foundation and the Oskar Öflund Foundation. In the final stages of the research work, I was also working in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.utu.fi/fi/yksikot/hum/yksikot/kulttuurihistoria/tutkimus/Sivut/travelling_notions_of_culture.aspx&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Travelling Notions of Culture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; project, funded by the Academy of Finland.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A monograph based on my PhD dissertation was published in February 2017 with the title &lt;a href=&#34;./publications/schlegel-monograph/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Romantic Idea of the Golden Age in Friedrich Schlegel’s Philosophy of History&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to that, I have published many research articles about Friedrich Schlegel.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
